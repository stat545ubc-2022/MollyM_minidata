## MollyM_minidata

This repository was built to complete mini-data analysis projects 1 and 2 for STAT 545 at UBC. 
It contains the code for both milestones (as .rmd files), the image files so that the markdowns print correctly, and the "output" folder for project 2. 
(note: this is a new repository. My original repository got very messed up with trying to push/pull stuff so I just made a new one. I'm going to come to office hours next week to ask about it!)

### Milestone 1: 
* Used tools for basic data exploration, graph making, summarizing, and using git. 
* Includes the RMD file mollym_data_analysis_project_1_v2.Rmd, and the image folder mollym_data_analysis_project_1_v2_file

### Milestone 2: 
* Used tools for sharing/uploading data, regression modeling, some additional graphing and tibble making, and using git. 
* Includes the RMD file milestone_2.rmd, the image folder milestone-2_files/figure-gfm, and the "output" folder which includes a tibble and .rds file.
